# Abhinna-Parajuli-aka-whoami
I am Abhinna Parajuli. You will be shocked now. I am just a 13 year kiddo making a Portfolio website for my own company. Shocking isn't it? Ok Besides that I have worked in Web Development and App Development for 2+ years and also I am learning Cyber Security for my own company named Blue Space. I have made many Website projects and apps and also taught my seniors and guided them how to be good at coding and programming also motivated them. You also can add me on my Discord --> whoami#8828.
